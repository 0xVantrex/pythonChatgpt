#arithmetic operators
x=7
y=3
print(x+y) #addition
print(x-y) #subtraction
print(x*y) #multiplication
print(x/y) #division
print(x%y) #remainder
print(x**y) #exponentiaition
print(x//y)  #floor division

#comparison operators
print (x==y) #equal to
print (x!=y) #not equal to
print ( x > y) #greater than
print (x< y) # less than
print ( x <= y) #less than or equal to
print ( x>= y) # greater thatn or equal to

#logical operators
print (x > 5 and y < 10 ) # both should be true
print (x > 5  or y < 10 ) # one should be true
print(not(x>5 and y < 10))
